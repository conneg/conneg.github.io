> Content negotiation is a mechanism defined in the HTTP specification that makes it possible to serve different versions of a document (or more generally, a resource representation) at the same URI, so that user agents can specify which version fit their capabilities the best.

Content Negotiation is a powerful part of HTTP which is often overlooked,
misunderstood, or poorly implemented.

The hope of this site and the [conneg](http://github.com/conneg) GitHub
organization is to improve the tooling and information about this powerful
facet of HTTP and related protocols.
